*** RELALG ***

Implementation of relational algebra in Typed Racket (http://www.racket-lang.org/)


Implemented relational operators are those featured in Chris Date's "Introduction to Database Systems" (8th ed., 2003)  and the more recent "SQL and Relational Theory" by the same
author (2009).

1.  "Original" operators (i.e., originally postulated by Ted Codd, but implemented here as defined in Date, 2003) are:
    - union
    - intersect
    - difference
    - product
    - join and theta-join
    - project
    - restrict
    - divide
    - rename (= Date 2003 addition)

2.  Additional operators:
    - semijoin
    - semidifference
    - extend
    - summarize (TBD)
    - image (new in Date 2009: makes summarize superfluous) (TBD)
